                <h2>Our Newest Location</h2>
                <p>Rome is well known for it's place in history&ndash;both in the secular world, and in the religious world. In ancient days, Christ's apostles taught the gospel amongst the Romans, and many were baptized.</p>
                <p>Now, Rome is home to 25,956 members of the church, as of 2016. The announcement of a temple in this historic location came as a surprise and a long awaited blessing for these saints. The temple was dedicated on March 10, 2019, and began opperation soon after, on March 19.</p>
                <p>With the dedication of the new Rome Italy temple, we are pleased to announce the opening of our latest location as well! Located just south of the temple, our <i>Temple Inn & Suites - Rome</i>&nbsp; is the perfect place to stay while visiting this historic temple. </p>
                <p> For more information about this location, visit our <a href="#">temples</a> page, or <a href="#">book a stay now!</a></p>

                <h2>An Inspired Mission</h2>
                <h3>By Samantha Galvez</h3>
                <p>Here at Temple Inn & Suites, we understand the importance the temple is in the lives of members worldwide. Our founders, Brittany Bishop, Alexandra Martinez, and Gerald Anderson, have each spent their lives involved in temple work one way or another, and have come to appreciate the blessings the temple brings. They sought out a way to make these blessings more accessable for everyone. The Church is constantly building temples to give more and more members worldwide access to them, but some still have to travel long distances to reach them.</p>
                <p>"I was inspired by a story of a family who had to travel several hundred miles to be sealed in the temple, and wondered how they managed it," Brittany said once. "It wasn't cheap to travel. This is when I first felt there was more I could do."</p>
                <p>Many hours of thought were put into what eventually became Temple Inn & Suites&ndash;a low cost, easily accessable hotel chain located conveniently near temples. We continue to grow to serve more members, hoping to eventually have at least a small facility located near every temple. We thank you for your support!</p>
